					<p>My name is Kyle Fernelius. I was born and raised in Utah, along with my 4 other siblings. All my education has been in health care clinical work, specifically in nursing. After working in various roles in health care for almost a decade, I've realized nursing is not for me.</p>
					<p>I currently work for the University of Utah Hospital in the Medical Staff Office as a Credentialing Specialist, making sure providers are in compliance with the educational, skill, and licensure standards set by the federal government. I am pursuing web development because I see it as an opportunity to expand my education and knowledge of important skills that are needed in today's technology industry. </p>
